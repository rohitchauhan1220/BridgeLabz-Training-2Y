//Write a program to create a basic calculator for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should ask for two numbers (floating point) and perform all the operations
//Hint =>
//Create a variable number1 and number2 and take user inputs.
//Perform Arithmetic Operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division assign the result to a variable, and finally print the result
//I/P => number1, number2
//O/P => The addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division value of 2 numbers ___ and ___ is ___, ____, ____, and ___
